# Password Generator


## introduction
Hello and thanks for stopping by to see my password generator.
This is the first project I have worked on that requires Javascript.
There are four files needed for this project as follows. 

## HTML
The Index.html file is very basic with only a few object that are mostly interactive. There is a button that starts the process required to generate a password and a text area where the password is displayed.
After you click the password a field box is generated to collect the data, (how many characters should your password be) the text assigned to the textbox suggest a password’s length should be at least 8 but not more then 128 characters. If the correct number of characters is selected you will then be prompted for data types. You may choose any combination of numbers, letters or special characters you wish. After you choose your characters you will be shown what characters you choose and what character you did not choose. After you are told what you have chosen a password is generated. However, if you choose more or less than the allowable characters you will be told you’re a dummy and the page will refresh. Just kidding, the page just refreshes. 

## CSS
There is a CSS style sheet as well that gives some basic style to the page. There is not really much to the html or the css file. 


## Javascript 
The Js file has five arrays, two sets of if statements, a for loop, a random number generator and a couple of listener events. All of these items combined with window alerts and window prompts create the behind the scene actions needed for this generator to work.

## Ackknowledgements
 I worked on this generator with my tutor Joem and my son Elijah both of whom were a great help.
